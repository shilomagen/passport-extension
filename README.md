### Gamkenbot Extension

#### Popup `src/popup/popup.tsx`

In Chrome extension development, a "popup" is a small window that appears when a user clicks on the
extension icon in the browser toolbar. The popup can display information or provide functionality
related to the extension. The popup window can be a basic HTML file or a more complex React, Vue, or
Angular app.

#### Content Script `src/content-script/content-script.ts`

A "content script" is a JavaScript file that runs in the context of a web page, similar to a browser
extension. Content scripts can manipulate the DOM of a web page, modify its appearance, or interact
with the page's JavaScript API. In Chrome extension development, content scripts are located in a
separate folder named "content_scripts".

#### Background Page `src/background-page.ts`

In Chrome extension development, a "background page" is a JavaScript file that runs in the
background of the browser and can listen for events, perform actions, and communicate with other
components of the extension. The background page runs separately from the content scripts and popup
window, allowing it to execute long-running processes or perform actions even when the user is not
actively interacting with the extension. The background page is defined in the "background" field of
the extension's manifest file.
